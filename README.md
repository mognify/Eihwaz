originally named Orient, the purpose of this program is to grant versatile automation abilities. Efficiency follows expansion, unfortunately.

began with Java's Robot API, then added OpenCV's template matching, and expanded on the versatility of each

future aspirations are with audio, graphs, connecting to other apis... xd and somehow incorporating blockchain/crypto stuff...

i'll add a command list here eventually, but it's visible in the ourageously massive switch case within ControlEngine.java's run method lmao
